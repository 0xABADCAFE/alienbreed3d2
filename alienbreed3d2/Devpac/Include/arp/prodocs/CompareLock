     NAME
	  CompareLock -	Compares two locks for "equality"

     SYNOPSIS
	  Result = CompareLock(	Lock1, Lock2 )
	   D0			   D0	  D1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	may be used to determine if two	file Locks
	  obtained with	the DOS	Lock() function	belong to the same
	  file/object.	Using this library call	allows an application
	  to avoid using private information; this call	may be updated
	  if/when a DOS	Packet ACTION_COMPARE_LOCK is implemented.

     INPUTS
	  Lock1	- Pointer to a lock

	  Lock2	- Pointer to a lock

     RESULTS
	  Result - Result is a return code as documented in
		  arpbase.[hi] A zero return code indicates that the
		  locks	refer to the same filesystem object, i.e., are
		  "equal".  Assembly language programmers may rely on
		  the Z-Flag return from this function.

     BUGS
	  Caveat, this function	now uses information that is
	  considered "private" to each filehandler; thus, it is
	  possible it will give	an erroneous result if somebody
	  implements a funny filehandler.  This	function was included
	  primarily for	the Rename program, to prevent Rename from
	  creating directory loops that	cause the directory to be lost
	  in BCPL-space.
