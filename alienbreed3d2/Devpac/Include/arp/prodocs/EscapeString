     NAME
	  EscapeString -- convert escape characters in string.

     SYNOPSIS
	  NewLength = EscapeString( "String" )
	      D0		       A0

     FUNCTION
	  This function	scans the string, replacing all	escaped
	  characters with the correct byte value.  This	function uses
	  the byte stored in ArpBase.ESCChar to	detect the escape
	  values. This defaults	to the undocumented BCPL '*'
	  character, but the Set program provides users	with a method
	  for changing this default.

	  This function	currently recognizes the following special
	  characters:
		  N   -	newline
		  T   -	horizontal tab
		  V   -	vertical tab
		  B   -	backspace
		  R   -	return
		  F   -	formfeed
		  E   -	escape (ascii 27 decimal)
		  Xnn -	character representd by	hex value nn.

	  The above may	be either upper	or lower case.	If this
	  function finds an escaped character which is not one of the
	  above, it will return	the character value (i.e. '\A' will be
	  replaced by the single character 'A'.	The sequence '\\' is
	  replaced by the single character '\',	and so on.)

	  For sending hexcodes,	the \x argument	may be followed	by
	  either one or	two hex	digits,	in either upper	or lower case.

     INPUTS
	  string -- pointer to a null terminated ASCII string.

     RESULT
	  NewCount -- The new length of	the string.

     ADDITIONAL	NOTES
	  For easy use in assembly language parsers, this function
	  will return with the A0 register unchanged.

     BUGS
	  This function	overwrites the original	string with the	new
	  string so if you wish	to retain a pristine copy of the
	  string, copy it first.
