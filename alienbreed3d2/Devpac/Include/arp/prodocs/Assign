     NAME
	  Assign - Assigns a logical device name

     SYNOPSIS
	  Result = Assign("name","physical")
	    D0		    A0	      A1

     FUNCTION
	  Assign "name"	to "physical device".  This function correctly
	  handles multiple calls with the same arguments, it is	not
	  necessary to check for previous assigns, or cancel them
	  before calling Assign() with a new assignment.

     INPUTS
	  "name" - Name	to give	to physical device.

	  "physical" - Name of file or device to assign	"name".	 If
		  name is ZERO,	remove existing	assignment.

     RESULT
	  Result - If return is	ASSIGN_OK, then	a DeviceInfo entry has
		  been created for requested name, and "name" may be
		  used as a synonym for	"physical".  Otherwise,	return
		  is an	error as documented in arpbase.[hi]

     BUGS
	  None known.
