     NAME
	  ObtainResidentPrg -- Obtains a resident program for your
	  use.

     SYNOPSIS
	  node = ObtainResidentPrg("name")

     FUNCTION
	  Part of the resident program manager.	 This function
	  searches the ResidentPrg list	for a currently	resident
	  program of BaseName("name"). If found, it increments the
	  usage	count of this program, indicating that this code
	  segment has an additional user, and should not be expunged.
	  You do not need to Forbid() before calling this function.

     INPUTS
	  name - pointer to a null terminated pathname.	 This may be
		  any valid AmigaDOS pathname, but only	the BaseName
		  of the path is compared and stored.

     RESULT
	  node - If found, a pointer to	the resident program node for
		  the program.	Note that this is not the actual code
		  segment, the code segment is stored in a location
		  inside this structure. If NULL, either the name
		  could	not be found, or the checksum for this program
		  was invalid. More information	is available by
		  calling IoErr().

     BUGS
