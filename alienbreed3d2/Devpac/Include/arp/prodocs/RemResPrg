     NAME
	  RemResidentPrg -- Remove a program from the resident list,
		  freeing it's node and	code segments.

     SYNOPSIS
	  usage	= RemResidentPrg("name")
	    d0			   a0

     FUNCTION
	  Attempts to remove a Resident	program	from the resident
	  list.	 The value returned is the actual usage	count of the
	  code you are trying to remove, so if it is non-zero the
	  removal failed, since	there are currently processes using
	  that code.  Note that	it is not an error to remove a non-
	  existant program.

	  For a	general	discussion on ARP's resident list, see the
	  manual page for AddResidentPrg().

     INPUTS
	  name - pointer to a null terminated pathname.	 This may be
		  any valid AmigaDOS pathname, but only	the BaseName
		  of the path is compared and stored.

     RESULT
	  usage	- If usage was zero, then the node was freed and the
		  code was unloaded, otherwise,	folks are using	this
		  code and it must stay	resident for a while yet.

     BUGS
	  None known
