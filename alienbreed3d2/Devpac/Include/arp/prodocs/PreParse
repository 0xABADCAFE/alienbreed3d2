     NAME
	  PreParse -- Create a tokenized string	suitable for
	  PatternMatch.

     SYNOPSIS
	  IsWild = PreParse("Source", "Dest")
	    d0		       a0	a1

     FUNCTION
	  In order for a string	to be submitted	directly to pattern
	  match, the wildcard string must be composed of preparsed
	  tokens (these	are listed in arpbase.[ih]).  This function
	  takes	a normal wildcarded source string, and creates the
	  tokenized output string.  This tokenized output string may
	  then be used as the 'pat' parameter to PatternMatch.

     INPUTS
	  Source - pointer to wildcarded unparsed string.

	  dest - pointer to buffer to place the	parsed string in. The
		  length of the	resulting string will not be larger
		  than the source string.

     RESULT
	  IsWild - TRUE	if any wildcards at all	were encountered,
		  false	otherwise.

     BUGS
	  None known

     SEE ALSO
	  PatternMatch(), FindFirst(), FindNext()
