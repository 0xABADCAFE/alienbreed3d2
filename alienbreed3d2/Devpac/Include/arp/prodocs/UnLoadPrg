     NAME
	  UnLoadPrg -- UnLoad a	program	received from LoadPrg().

     SYNOPSIS
	  UnLoadPrg(Segment)
		       d1

     FUNCTION
	  The function LoadPrg() searches the Resident list for
	  programs before searching the	user's path. Attempting	to
	  free this segment using UnLoadSeg() will result in disaster,
	  since	the program is still logged on the resident list, and
	  could	still be in use	by other processes.  This function
	  correctly handles all	cases that can occur, calling
	  LoadSeg() or ReleaseResidentPrg() as appropriate.

	  For a	general	discussion on ARP's resident list, see the
	  manual page for AddResidentPrg().

     INPUTS
	  Segment - pointer to a segment obtained from LoadPrg()

     RESULT
	  Nothing

     BUGS
	  None known

     SEE ALSO
	  ObtainResidentPrg(), AddResidentPrg(),LoadPrg(),
	  CheckSumPrg(), RemResidentPrg(), ReleaseResidentPrg(),
	  BaseName().
