     FUNCTION
	  AddDADevs provides a method of searching the DevInfo list
	  for specific types of	entries, and adding them to a user
	  private DA list in a way that	is safe	for multitasking, and
	  easily accessible for	assembler or higher level languages.

	  The list is sorted first by class, and then
	  alphanumerically, by name.  The user is responsible for
	  freeing the nodes allocated by this function.

     INPUTS
	  dalist - pointer to a	DA list	header

	  selectmask --	the selection mask which determines which
		  devices will added to	the DA list.  See defines
		  arpbase.[hi]

     RESULT
	  numenteries -	The number of entries actually added to	the
		  users	DA list	will be	returned as the	value of this
		  function, and	the list nodes will have been
		  allocated and	added to dalist.

     BUGS
	  None known.
