     FUNCTION
	  This function	will cause a currently running program to
	  terminate.  It will first CloseLibrary(ArpBase), which will
	  cause	all tracked resources to be freed.  It will then force
	  DOS to unload	your program, returning	the error code to the
	  CLI and Fault	to the caller.

		  convention, 0	means a	normal exit.

		  error	code which is used with	the "Why" program. If
		  ReturnCode is	ZERO, this value is ignored.

     RESULT
	  No results, in fact, no return.
