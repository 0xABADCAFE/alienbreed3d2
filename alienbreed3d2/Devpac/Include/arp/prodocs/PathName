     NAME
	  PathName - Find complete pathname of file/directory.

     SYNOPSIS
	  Length = PathName(Lock, Destination, NumberNames)
	    D0		     D0	      A0	  D1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	builds a path name which completely describes
	  the path from	the root of the	filing system to the file on
	  which	the Lock has been obtained.  The name returned is of
	  the form:
		  Volume:Dir1/Dir2/Dir3/.../Name .RE 0

9     INPUTS
	  Lock - This is a lock	on the file or directory obtained from
		  Lock() or DupLock(), or some such function.

	  Destination -	This is	the area of memory to place the
		  filename in.

	  NumberNames -	This is	the number of names that can be	placed
		  in the destination area.  This should	be some
		  multiple of FSIZE.

     RESULT
	  Length - If the return is non-zero, then the pathname	has
		  been placed in Destination, and the return value is
		  the total length of the pathname in characters.  A
		  zero return indicates	a problem, either a buffer
		  overflow, or disk error.  IoErr() can	be of help in
		  this case.

     BUGS
	  None known.
