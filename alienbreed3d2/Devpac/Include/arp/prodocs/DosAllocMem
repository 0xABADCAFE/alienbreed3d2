     NAME
	  DosAllocMem -	AmigaDOS compatible memory allocator

     SYNOPSIS
	  memBlock = DosAllocMem( size_in_bytes	)
	     d0			     d0

     FUNCTION
	  This function	returns	a memory block of the size requested,
	  or NULL if the allocation failed.  The memory	will satisfy
	  the requirements of MEMF_PUBLIC | MEMF_CLEAR.

	  As expected by AmigaDOS, the total size of the memory	block
	  is stored at (memblock - 4), so the actual memory allocated
	  will always be four bytes larger than	size_in_bytes.

	  arp.library uses this	function to construct variable size
	  list nodes for its DA	(DosAllocMem) lists. Note that this is
	  NOT a	tracking function.

     INPUTS
	  size_in_bytes	- the size of the desired block	in bytes.

     RESULT
	  memBlock - a pointer to the allocated	free block.  This
		  block	will be	longword aligned, and the total	size
		  of the block is stored at (memblock -	4).  If	the
		  allocation failed, memBlock will be zero.

     ADDITIONAL	CONSIDERATIONS
	  The value returned by	DosAllocMem is a real pointer.	If you
	  need a BPTR, you must	convert	this value yourself.

     BUGS
	  None known.
