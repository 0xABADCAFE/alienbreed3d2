     NAME
	  LoadPrg -- Load a program by searching path.

     SYNOPSIS
	  segment = LoadPrg("name")
	    d0		      d1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	loads a	program	into memory, as	does
	  LoadSeg(), but unlike	LoadSeg() it searches first the	arp
	  maintained resident list, then the user specified path.  If
	  called from a	Workbench process, the resident	list, the
	  current directory, and the C:	logical	directory will be
	  searched, in that order. (This is the	CLI's default path.)

     INPUTS
	  "name" - pointer to a	null terminated	pathname of the
		  command to load.

     RESULT
	  segment - a BPTR to the loaded code, or NULL,	if an error
		  occured.  In the case	of an error, IoErr() should be
		  able to give you more	information.

     BUGS
	  None known
