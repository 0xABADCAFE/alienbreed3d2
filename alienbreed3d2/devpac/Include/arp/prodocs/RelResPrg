     NAME
	  ReleaseResidentPrg --	If segment is resident,	decrement
		  usage	count.

     SYNOPSIS
	  node = ReleaseResidentPrg(Segment)
				      d1

     FUNCTION
	  Since	each resident program may have more than one user at a
	  time,	a running usage	count of the current users is
	  maintained.  This can	be checked, for	example, before
	  attempting removal, to see if	it is possible to remove.
	  This function	searches the resident list for a node which
	  contains the Segment,	and if found, decrements its usage
	  count.

	  For a	general	discussion on ARP's resident list, see the
	  manual page for AddResidentPrg().

     INPUTS
	  Segment - Pointer to a loaded	code segment.

     RESULT
	  node - The corresponding resident node if found.  This value
		  should not be	used other than	as true	or false,
		  however, since there is no lock on the list after
		  this function	returns.

     BUGS
	  None known
