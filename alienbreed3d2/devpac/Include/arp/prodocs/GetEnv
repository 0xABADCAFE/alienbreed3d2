     NAME
	  GetEnv -- Get	the value of an	environment variable

     SYNOPSIS
	  strptr = Getenv("string", buffer, size)
	    d0		    A0	      A1     d0

     FUNCTION
	  This function	provides an environment	variable mechanism
	  compatible with MANX.	 Note that this	call is	more efficient
	  than using the manx getenv() function	call when arplibrary
	  is installed.

     INPUTS
	  string -- pointer to an environment variable name.

	  buffer -- a user allocated area which	will be	used to	store
		  the value associated with the	environment variable.
		  This may be NULL.

	  size -- size of buffer region	in bytes.

     RESULT
	  If found, a pointer to the start of the value	string for
	  that variable	will be	returned.  If buffer is	non-null, then
	  as much of the value string as allowed by size will be
	  copied into the user buffer.

     ADDTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
	  arp.libraries	environment variable mechanism is compatible
	  with the MANX	software, which	has set	the defacto standard
	  implementation for the Amiga.	 This call is NOT equivalent
	  to the Manx getenv() call, however.

	  You should run as Forbidden()	any code that uses or examines
	  the return value from	this function, which is	a pointer to
	  the global environment space of ArpLib.

     BUGS
	  None Known.
