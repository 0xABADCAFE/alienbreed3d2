     SYNOPSIS
	  msgport = CreatePort("Name", priority)
	    d0			 A0,	 D0 (0:8)

     FUNCTION
	  Creates a message port with the given	name and priority.
	  This function	is equivalent to that in amiga.lib, but	is
	  reentrant, and may be	called by assembly code.

     INPUTS
	  Name - pointer to a null terminated character	string,	or
		  NULL.	 If NULL, this function	will not attach	the
		  port to the system msgport list (it will be private
		  to the caller).

	  priority - the priority of this msgport (-128..127).

     RESULT

		  if port could	not be allocated.  If Name was non-
		  null,	then the port will have	been added to the
		  system's msgport list.

     BUGS
	  None known.
