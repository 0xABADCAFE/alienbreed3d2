     NAME
	  FPrintf - print formatted data on file.

     SYNOPSIS
	  count	= FPrintf(File,	"String", *args)
	    d0		   d0	   A0	    A1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	performs 'standard' C-style formatting of data
	  on the specified output file.	It uses	the exec function
	  RawDoFmt() to	do the actual formatting of the	data.  The %
	  types	supported by this function are quite standard, see any
	  C reference for details.

     INPUTS
	  File - A valid AmigaDOS output file handle, such as returned
		  by Open() or Output().

	  "String" - pointer to	a C-style format string.

	  *args	- Pointer to start of argument stream.

     RESULT
	  count	- if all goes well, the	total count of characters
		  actually written will	be returned.  If an error
		  occured, this	function will return -1.  If this
		  function is passed a NULL output filehandle, this
		  function will	return zero.

     ADDITIONAL	CONSIDERATIONS
	  You must be aware of the values actually passed to this
	  function by your compiler, especially	since some compilers
	  promote all values to	32 bit integers	in function calls.

     BUGS
	  None known.
