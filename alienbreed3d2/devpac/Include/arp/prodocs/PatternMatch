     NAME
	  PatternMatch - perform a wildcard match on a string

     SYNOPSIS
	  result = PatterMatch(pat,str)
	     D0			A0 A1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	compares a string to the given pattern and
	  determines if	it is a	valid match.  If so it returns a true
	  result.  If you are calling FindFirst()/FindNext() this
	  function, and	the related PreParse() function	are called for
	  you.	You will need this function to do pattern matching on
	  arbitrary text, for example, in a Search command in a	text
	  editor, or in	implementing a 'grep' program.	The pattern
	  must be constructed with special preparsed tokens and
	  supports the following patterns:

		  (p1|p2|p3)  One of the patterns p1, p2 or p3

		  ?	      Any single character

		  #<pat>      Pattern repeated 0 or more times

		  [class]     Character	class

		  [^class]    Negated character	class

		  {pat}	      Structure	tag for	replacement

		  *	      0	or more	occurances of any character

     INPUTS
	  char *pat - The pattern string to match against, this	is
		  only partially ascii,	the wildcard strings must be
		  converted to the appropriate token value as given in
		  the arpbase.[ih] files. The easiest way to do	this
		  is to	pass the string	to PatternMatch() (V33 of
		  arp.library).

	  char *str - The string to be matched

     RESULT
	  result - a boolean value indicating success/failure.

     BUGS
	  Character classes still do not work.
