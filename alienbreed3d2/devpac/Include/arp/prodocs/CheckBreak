     NAME
	  CheckBreak - Check for control C/D/E/F

     SYNOPSIS
	  BOOL = CheckAbort( Mask, (*Func)() )
	   d0		       D1	 A1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	checks for user	signals	as specified by	Mask,
	  calling an optional user function or returning the signals
	  received to the caller.

     INPUTS
	  Mask - One (or more) of SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C/D/E/F masks.

	  (*Func)() - an (optional) function to	call if	the BREAK
		  occured.

     RESULT
	  BOOL - If none of the	signals	specified in Mask were
		  received, then return	FALSE.	Otherwise, if
		  (*Func)() is NON-NULL, call the user defined
		  function, returning this value to caller.
		  Otherwise, return the	signal masks as	received.  For
		  this function, we guarantee all registers preserved,
		  except for D0, which will hold the masks.  The user
		  function may check D0	to determine which signals
		  were received.

	  Assembly language programmers	are provided with a pointer to
	  a "***BREAK" string in A1, suitable for a direct call	to
	  Puts() if desired.

     BUGS
	  None known.
