     NAME
	  GetTracker --	Get a tracking node for	resource tracking.

     SYNOPSIS
	  Tracker = GetTracker()
	    A1

     C_LANGUAGE	SYNOPSIS
	  Tracker = GetTracker(	ID )

     FUNCTION
	  Creates a DefaultTracker style node, which you must then
	  initialize according to the specific resource	you wish
	  tracked.  For	assembly language callers, this	includes
	  installing the ID into the DefaultTracker returned to	you.
	  For C	or other higher	language users,	this ID	is installed
	  for you by the glue routine.	For more information on	the
	  uses of each ID value, please	consult	the page for TRAK_IDS.

     INPUTS
	  ID - Higher level language users must	supply an ID as	a
		  parameter, these are defined in arpbase.[hi].

     RESULTS
	  Tracker - A pointer to a DefaultTracker, or NULL if the
		  allocation failed.

     ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE CONSIDERATIONS
	  This call preserves registers	D0/D1/A0, unless the request
	  fails	in which case D0 is set	to 0 for your convenience, as
	  a NULL result.  On sucess, register A1 is a pointer to the
	  tracking node, and the Z flag	is set NOT-ZERO.

     BUGS
	  TRAK_WINDOW suffers from the CloseWindowSafely() bug.
