     NAME
	  DosFreeMem - AmigaDOS	compatible memory freer.

     SYNOPSIS
	  DosFreeMem( memBlock )
			 A1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	frees a	memory block which was allocated using
	  DosAllocMem or was allocated by AmigaDOS.  If	this function
	  is passed a NULL pointer, no memory will be freed.

     INPUTS
	  memBlock - the pointer to a memblock returned	by
		  DosAllocMem().

     RESULT
	  The requested	memory block will be freed. No return is sent
	  to the user.

     ADDITIONAL	CONSIDERATIONS
	  memBlock is not a BPTR - if you are passing a	value obtained
	  from AmigaDOS, make sure you convert it from a BPTR to a
	  real pointer first!

     BUGS
	  None known.
