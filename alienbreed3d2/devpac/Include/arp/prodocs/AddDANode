     NAME
	  AddDANode - add a new	entry to a DAList

     SYNOPSIS
	  newnode = AddDANode( Data, *DALst, Length, ID	)
	    D0			A0	A1     D0    D1

     FUNCTION
	  AddDANode() creates and adds a node to the DAList header
	  specified by caller.	All nodes created by this function are
	  DirectoryEntry nodes (see arpbase.[hi] header	for the
	  definition of	this structure).  The caller is	responsible
	  for freeing all nodes	allocated by this function.

     INPUTS
	  Data - Pointer to data to be copied to de_Name field of the
		  new node. See	Length parameter.

	  DALst	 - Address of a	DA list	header for this	node.

	  Length - If 0, Data is assumed to be a null terminated
		  string. Otherwise, Length gives the amount of	memory
		  to copy to the de_Name field.

	  ID - ID is the secondary sort	key/type code. This will be
		  the de_Type variable of the new node.

     RESULT
	  newnode - A pointer to the node just added to	the DAList,
		  else NULL, if	an error occured.

     BUGS
	  None known.
