	  CloseWindowSafely( window, morewindows )
			       A0	 A1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	locates	any messages queued to the window
	  message port,	and returns them to the	sender.	 It then
	  closes the window.  This is necessary	for windows which
	  share	a common IDCMP,	otherwise GURU's are likely to occur.
	  If morewindows is NULL, then the msgport is freed also.

     INPUTS
	  window - window to close

	  morewindows -	If NULL, the msgport for this window will be
		  released.

     RESULTS
	  None.

     BUGS

	  was opened with the IDCMPFLags variable of the NewWindow
	  structure set	to NULL.
