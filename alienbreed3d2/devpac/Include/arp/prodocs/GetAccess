     NAME
	  GetAccess -- Locks access to a tracked resource.

     SYNOPSIS
	  Pointer = GetAccess( tracker )
	     d0			  A1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	returns	a pointer to a tracked resource, if
	  the resource is still	available, and locks it	into memory.
	  If the resource has been freed since the last	FreeAccess()
	  call,	the return value from this function will be NULL.  You
	  can then do a	FreeTrackedItem( tracker ) to release the
	  tracker, should you so desire.

	  If this function returns NON-NULL, then the resource will
	  once again be	locked into memory until the next FreeAccess()
	  call on this tracker.

     INPUTS
	  tracker -- the tracker for the resource you want to reclaim.

     RESULTS
	  Pointer -- pointer to	the resource or	NULL, if the resource
		  is gone.

     BUGS
	  None Known.
