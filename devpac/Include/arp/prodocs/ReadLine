     NAME
	  ReadLine - Get a line	from current input.

     SYNOPSIS
	  Count	= ReadLine("Address")
	   d0		      A0

     FUNCTION
	  This function	reads a	line of	up to MaxInputBuf characters
	  from stdin.  You must	have a buffer available	of this	size,
	  or you run the risk of overwriting innocent memory.
	  MaxInputBuf is defined in arpbase.[h|i].

	  This function	does no	editing	or echoing of the command
	  line,	although it does guarantee the returned	string is null
	  terminated.

     INPUTS
	  Address - Pointer to a 256 byte buffer to store the input
		  string in.

     RESULT
	  Count	- The actual count of the characters returned.
		  Address will contain a null terminated string	of
		  Count	characters.

     BUGS
	  None known

     ADDITIONAL	NOTES:
	  For the convenience of assembly language programs, A0	is
	  guaranteed to	contain	the same value on exit as it did on
	  entry.

     SEE ALSO
	  GADS,	EscapeString.
