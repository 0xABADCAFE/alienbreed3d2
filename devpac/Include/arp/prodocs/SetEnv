     NAME
	  Setenv - Set the value of an environment variable

     SYNOPSIS
	  BOOL = Setenv("string", buffer)
	   d0		   A0	     A1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	provides an environment	variable mechanism
	  compatible with MANX.	 Note that this	call is	more efficient
	  than using the manx setenv() function	call when arplibrary
	  is installed.

     INPUTS
	  string - pointer to an environment variable name.

	  buffer - a user allocated area which will contains the
		  values to be associated with this environment
		  variabnle.

     RESULT
	  BOOL - If the	value was succesfully established, a TRUE
		  result will be returned, otherwise, a	FALSE value
		  will be returned.

     ADDTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
	  MANX was the first to	implement environment variables	on the
	  Amiga.  As a result, we are trying to	be compatible with
	  their	implementation.

     BUGS
	  None known.
