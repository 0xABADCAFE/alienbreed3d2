     NAME
	  CheckSumPrg -- Calculate the checksum	on a resident program.

     SYNOPSIS
	  checksum = CheckSumPrg(node)
	      d0		  d1

     FUNCTION
	  All programs on the resident list are	checksummed when they
	  are added to the list.  On rare occasions, it	might be
	  necessary to recompute this checksum.	 This function
	  computes the checksum	on a resident program given its	node.
	  It does not change, compare or otherwise alter the node.  It
	  is also the only function which does not use the semaphore.
	  Therefore, the correct method	of using this function is:
		  Node = ObtainResidentProgram("name");
		  checksum = CheckSumPrg(Node);
		  ReleaseResidentPrg(Node->rpn_Segment);

	  For a	general	discussion on ARP's resident list, see the
	  manual page for AddResidentPrg().

     INPUTS
	  node - Pointer to a resident program node.

     RESULT
	  checksum - A newly calculated	checksum.

     BUGS
	  The checksum is not perfect, but it should catch most
	  problems.  A tradeoff	was made with respect to the time it
	  takes	to do more complex checksums.
