     NAME
	  CreateTaskResList - Create a new nested ResList for this
	  task

     SYNOPSIS
	  ResList = CreateTaskResList()
	     D0

     FUNCTION
	  Create a new Resource	list for this task, and	insert it at
	  the HEAD of the ResourceArray	list.

	  You do not normally need to use CreateTaskResList, because
	  the functions	which insert tracked items into	the task
	  reslist will automaticly create a reslist if one did not
	  exist	before.

	  This function	may be used to explictly create	a nested
	  ResList for this task; all resources allocated after
	  CreateTaskReslist will be stored in the new ResList until
	  you call FreeTaskResList.  This would	allow you, for
	  instance, to call CreateTaskResList at the start of a
	  function, and	FreeTaskResList	at the end of the function,
	  and any resources tracked in the interum would be freed; but
	  all other tracked resources for the task would remain
	  tracked.

	  All Task reslists will also be automaticly freed when	you
	  call CloseLibrary() or ArpExit()

     INPUTS
	  None

     RESULT
	  reslist - Pointer to the new list, or	NULL if	failure.
		  Assembly language programers may rely	on the Z flag
		  value	on return from this function.

     BUGS
	  None known
